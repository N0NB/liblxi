=== liblxi v1.5 ===


Changes since liblxi v1.4:

 * Add support for mDNS/DNS-SD discovery

   Add parameter to lxi_discover() so it is possible to select discovery
   using VXI-11 or mDNS/DNS-SD.

   If detected available, Avahi is used as the mDNS/DNS-SD backend
   implementation.

 * Print errors to stderr

 * Update README



Changes since liblxi v1.3:

 * Fix discover output strings

   Discovery of multiple LXI instruments revealed a bug in the id string
   handling which results in garbled output strings. Adding missing string
   termination fixes this.

 * Add timeout handling for raw/TCP

 * Update examples

 * Cleanup

 * Update README

 * Add support for configurable protocol backends

   Reworked the code to support configurable protocol backends. Currently
   supported protocols include VXI11 and raw TCP. In the future support for
   HiSlip can be added.



Changes since liblxi v1.2:

 * Fix building with multiple jobs (make -jN, N>1)

 * Update README



Changes since liblxi v1.1:

 * Added AUTHORS file

 * Update COPYING

 * Update README

 * Update connect test

 * Improve lxi_connect() with device name and timeout

 * Make timeout error message human readable

   Lets explain the most common error, that is timeout, in a human readable
   format.

 * Fix timeout handling

 * Use thread-safe version of VXI11 function calls

 * Autogenerate VXI11 RPC functions

   Automatically generate VXI11 RPC functions instead of using bundled or
   system provided VXI11 library. This allows us to generate thread-safe
   versions of the VXI11 RPC functions in the future.



Changes since liblxi v1.0:

 * Fixed instrument not responding

   Use the default LAN Device Name of "inst0". Some instruments do not
   respond if this device name is not used.

 * Remove unused rpcgen tool check

 * Cleanup rpc header check

 * Add support for use of system VXI library

   Added configure option '--with-vxi=[internal/system]' which allows the
   user to decide whether to use the internally bundled VXI library or the
   VXI library provided by the system.

   By default the internal VXI library is used.



liblxi v1.0:

 * First release (stable)
