=== LXI library (liblxi) ===


1. Introduction

    The LXI library (liblxi) is a library which offers a simple API for
    communicating with LXI devices. The API allows applications to discover
    devices on your network and send LXI commands and receive responses.

    The library is based on the VXI11 RPC protocol implementation which is part
    of the asynDriver EPICS module, which, at time of writing, is available
    from: http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/index.html


2. Status

    The code is currently considered experimental. API and internals are
    subject to change. Use on your own risk.


3. Installation

    Install steps:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

4. API usage

    Here is a simple code example on how to use the liblxi API:

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <string.h>
     #include <lxi/lxi.h>

     int main() 
     {
         char response[LXI_MESSAGE_LENGTH_MAX];
         int device, length, timeout = 1;
         char *command = "*IDN?";

         device = lxi_connect("10.42.0.42");
    
         // Send SCPI command
         lxi_send(device, command, strlen(command), timeout);

         // Wait for response
         lxi_receive(device, response, &length, timeout);
    
         printf("%s\n", response);
    
         lxi_disconnect(device);
     }

    The example above prints the ID string of the LXI instrument. For example,
    a Rigol DS1104Z oscilloscope would respond:
    
    RIGOL TECHNOLOGIES,DS1104Z,DS1ZA1712064242,00.04.03
